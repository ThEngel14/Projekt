dart directory contains scripts for running code and processing DART buoy data.

    GaugeErrors2.py is module containing all analysis codes.  
        >>> import GaugeErrors2 as GE
        >>> GE.make_all()

    dart/simulation directory contains code to run the dart simulations.
       run_all.py  to run all simulations (with each source)
      
       These runs were performed with GeoClaw from
        https://github.com/clawpack/clawpack-4.x

JapanRunup directory contains runup results along the coast of Japan
   plotdata.py plots this data and creates datapoints.png

   These runs were done with bathymetry that cannot be redistributed.
